# Security

Phase 3 separates authentication from authorization:

- **Authentication** is handled by Better Auth in `packages/auth`. It identifies a user with email/password and stores secure server-side sessions in PostgreSQL. `AUTH_SECRET` is required at startup and is never imported by client code.
- **Authorization** is handled by server utilities in `packages/auth/src/authorization.ts`. Operations on existing organization or project resources check the authenticated user, membership, role, and project ownership. The first-user bootstrap is an exception: it requires an authenticated user, verifies that the user has no authorized project, then creates the first organization, project, and `OWNER` membership transactionally. A browser-supplied organization ID is only an input to a membership query, never proof of access.

## Identity and sessions

The existing `users` table is the single application identity. Better Auth uses it through the Drizzle adapter; `accounts`, `sessions`, and `verifications` are authentication tables. Sessions use HTTP-only, secure-in-production cookies with the `emora` prefix and SameSite behavior provided by Better Auth. OAuth accounts can be added through the same `accounts` table later.

## Tenant isolation and RBAC

Organizations are the tenant boundary. Projects join to their organization, and all future project resources must be reached through an authorized project query. Roles are ordered `VIEWER < MEMBER < ADMIN < OWNER`; destructive ownership operations must require `OWNER`, while normal project access starts at `VIEWER`.

The middleware provides an early redirect for missing session cookies, but protected pages and data actions must still call `requireAuth`, `requireOrganizationMember`, `requireOrganizationRole`, or `requireProjectAccess`. Frontend filtering is never authorization.

## Audit and secrets

`recordAuditEvent` writes security events to the existing `audit_logs` table after validating UUIDs and metadata with Zod. Audit metadata must not contain passwords, session secrets, tokens, API keys, or sensitive emotional content. Secrets belong only in environment configuration; they are not logged or sent to client components.

## Read Audit Semantics

For the Slice 2 latest-state read (`GET /api/v1/projects/[projectId]/profiles/[profileId]/states/latest`):

- Failed or unauthorized reads (`401`, `403`, `404`) create no durable `audit_logs` row. Structured operational logging may still occur.
- The `404` response remains indistinguishable from "no state exists" and introduces no existence oracle.
- A successful `200` read writes exactly one `emotional_state.read` audit row, with the existing safe metadata allow-list (operational identifiers only).
- If that audit row cannot be written, the read fails closed: the response is `500` inside the existing safe error envelope, never an unaudited `200`.

The authoritative decision record, including provenance and superseded alternatives, is `docs/decisions/read-audit-semantics.md`.
