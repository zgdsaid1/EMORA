# API

Next.js Route Handlers are the REST API boundary. All endpoints are versioned
under `/api/v1`, run on the Node.js runtime (`force-dynamic`), and share one
frozen error envelope: `{ "error": { "code", "message", "requestId" } }` with a
fixed safe message per code — internal errors, SQL, stack traces, and payload
content are never returned.

## Authentication

Every endpoint requires a server-side Better Auth session (HTTP-only cookie).
Session identity is always derived server-side via `requireAuth`; no caller can
assert an identity or an organization through the request.

## Authorization

Authorization is server-derived via `requireProjectAccess(userId, projectId,
minimumRole)` against `organization_members` joined through the project's
`organization_id`. Roles are ordered `VIEWER < MEMBER < ADMIN < OWNER`.

- Write operations require `MEMBER` or above.
- Read operations require `VIEWER` or above.
- A browser-supplied organization identifier is never trusted.

## Endpoints

### GET /api/v1/projects

Lists the projects the authenticated user may use. Scope is server-derived
from `organization_members` joined through each project's `organization_id`;
a browser-supplied organization is never trusted.

- **Authorization:** authenticated session; `VIEWER` or above (any membership).
- **Success (200):** `requestId`, `projects` — array of `projectId`, `name`,
  `slug`, `createdAt`, ordered by `createdAt ASC, id ASC`. Complete list; no
  pagination.
- **Empty result:** `200` with `"projects": []`.
- **Errors:** `unauthenticated` (401), `internal_error` (500).

### POST /api/v1/bootstrap

Creates the first organization, its initial project, and an `OWNER` membership
for the authenticated user when that user has no authorized projects. The
organization and project are created by this request; an existing organization
cannot be selected or joined through bootstrap.

- **Authorization:** authenticated Better Auth session. User identity and owner
  role are derived server-side.
- **Body (strict JSON):** `organizationName`, `organizationSlug`, `projectName`,
  `projectSlug`. Names are trimmed and must not be empty. Slugs must match
  `^[a-z0-9]+(?:-[a-z0-9]+)*$`; slugs are not generated or transformed.
- **Success (201):** `requestId`, `organizationId`, `organizationName`,
  `organizationSlug`, `projectId`, `projectName`, `projectSlug`. The created
  project then appears through the existing `GET /api/v1/projects` discovery.
- **Conflict (409):** `bootstrap_already_initialized` when the user already has
  an authorized project; `bootstrap_slug_conflict` when either slug conflicts.
- **Atomicity and audit:** organization, project, `OWNER` membership, and one
  `organization.bootstrapped` audit row (`resourceType: organization`,
  `resourceId` set to the new organization ID) are written in a single
  transaction. Audit metadata contains `projectId`, `organizationMemberId`,
  `role: OWNER`, `requestId`, and `outcome: succeeded`. Any insertion or audit
  failure rolls back the entire bootstrap.
- **Errors:** `unauthenticated` (401), `invalid_input` (400),
  `invalid_content_type` (400), `bootstrap_already_initialized` (409),
  `bootstrap_slug_conflict` (409), `internal_error` (500).

### GET /api/v1/projects/[projectId]/profiles

Lists the profiles of exactly one project.

- **Authorization:** `VIEWER` minimum via `requireProjectAccess`. A project the
  caller may not access — including one that does not exist — is
  indistinguishable from unauthorized (`forbidden`, 403; no existence oracle).
  The query is constrained to the `(projectId)` scope, so a profile of another
  project is never returned.
- **Success (200):** `requestId`, `profiles` — array of `profileId`,
  `externalReference`, `createdAt`, ordered by `createdAt ASC, id ASC`.
  Complete list; no pagination.
- **Empty result:** `200` with `"profiles": []`.
- **Errors:** `invalid_input` (400), `unauthenticated` (401), `forbidden` (403),
  `internal_error` (500).

### POST /api/v1/projects/[projectId]/profiles

Creates one immutable profile record (no update or delete exists).

- **Authorization:** `MEMBER` minimum, server-side only.
- **Headers:** `content-type: application/json` (non-JSON → 400
  `invalid_content_type`).
- **Body (strict; unknown fields rejected at the top level and inside
  `personalityProfile`):** `externalReference` (1–128 printable ASCII,
  unique within the project), `personalityProfile` with exactly the six
  model-configuration inputs `emotionalSensitivity`, `baselineTrust`,
  `baselineAnxiety`, `attachmentSensitivity`, `nostalgiaSensitivity`,
  `jealousySensitivity` (each a finite number in [0,1]), and optional
  `additionalTraits` (≤32 keys of 1–64 characters with finite [0,1] number
  values; stored metadata only — never consumed by the deterministic
  dynamics). Malformed JSON or any invalid value → 400 `invalid_input` with no
  profile persistence and no audit row.
- **Scientific profile-input disclosure:** profile parameters are model
  configuration values supplied by the client. They are not a psychological
  assessment, personality measurement, diagnosis, or clinical assessment of
  any person, and EMORA does not validate them against real-world
  psychological state.
- **Success (201):** `requestId`, `projectId`, `profileId`, `externalReference`,
  `createdAt`. No profile parameters are echoed.
- **Duplicate behavior:** a second profile with the same `externalReference` in
  the same project returns `external_reference_conflict` (409) with a fixed
  safe message; the same `externalReference` in a different project is
  accepted. There is no idempotent-create behavior and no `Idempotency-Key`.
- **Audit:** a successful creation writes exactly one `audit_logs` row (action
  `emotional_profile.created`) in the same transaction as the profile insert,
  with metadata limited to `projectId`, `profileId`, `requestId`, `outcome`. If
  that audit row cannot be written, the transaction rolls back and the request
  fails with `internal_error` (500) — never an unaudited creation. Duplicate
  attempts and failed requests create no audit rows.
- **Errors:** `invalid_input` (400), `invalid_content_type` (400),
  `unauthenticated` (401), `forbidden` (403), `external_reference_conflict`
  (409), `internal_error` (500).

### POST /api/v1/projects/[projectId]/profiles/[profileId]/transitions

Runs one deterministic emotional transition for the profile and persists the
result atomically (event, state, and audit rows in a single transaction).

- **Authorization:** `MEMBER` minimum.
- **Headers:** `content-type: application/json`; a mandatory `Idempotency-Key`
  (8–128 printable ASCII characters). Replaying the same key with the same
  payload returns the original result (`duplicate: true`, HTTP 200) without a
  second write; the same key with a different payload returns 409.
- **Body:** `valence` (-1..1), `intensity`, `relevance`, `surprise`,
  `uncertainty` (each 0..1), optional bounded `context` object, optional
  `timestamp`. Unknown fields are rejected.
- **Success (201 / 200 replay):** `requestId`, `duplicate`, `projectId`,
  `profileId`, `eventId`, `stateId`, `timestamp`, `emotionVector` (love, fear,
  nostalgia, jealousy, trust, anger, joy), `dimensions` (valence, arousal,
  intensity), `modelIdentity` (modelVersionId, name, version,
  providerIdentifier, providerVersion), `parameterIdentity`, `initialized`,
  `disclosure`, `disclosureText`.
- **Errors:** `invalid_input` (400), `invalid_content_type` (400),
  `idempotency_key_required` (400), `unauthenticated` (401), `forbidden` (403),
  `profile_not_found` (404), `idempotency_conflict` (409), `temporal_conflict`
  (409), `concurrency_conflict` (409), `profile_data_invalid` (500),
  `internal_error` (500).

### GET /api/v1/projects/[projectId]/profiles/[profileId]/states/latest

Returns the most recently persisted computational state for the profile. This
is a read: it never writes product state and never mutates history.

- **Authorization:** `VIEWER` minimum. Lookup is constrained to the
  `(projectId, profileId)` pair, so a profile from another project is never
  returned (indistinguishable from "no state yet").
- **Success (200):** `requestId`, `projectId`, `profileId`, `stateId`,
  `timestamp`, `emotionVector` (love, fear, nostalgia, jealousy, trust, anger,
  joy), `dimensions` (valence, arousal, intensity), `modelIdentity`
  (modelVersionId, name, version, providerIdentifier, providerVersion),
  `parameterIdentity`, `initialized`, `disclosure`, `disclosureText`.
- **Errors:** `invalid_input` (400), `unauthenticated` (401), `forbidden` (403),
  `state_not_found` (404), `state_data_invalid` (500, persisted state failed
  domain validation), `internal_error` (500).
- **Audit:** every successful 200 read writes exactly one `audit_logs` row with
  action `emotional_state.read` whose metadata is limited to operational
  identifiers (`projectId`, `profileId`, `stateId`, `requestId`, `outcome`).
  If that audit row cannot be written, the read fails closed with
  `internal_error` (500) instead of returning an unaudited 200 — see
  `docs/decisions/read-audit-semantics.md`. No emotion values, dimensions,
  confidence, raw JSONB, context, memories, embeddings, payloads, or secrets are
  recorded. Failed requests (401, 403, 404, 500) create no audit rows and use
  structured operational logging only.

### GET /api/v1/projects/[projectId]/profiles/[profileId]/states

Returns a bounded newest-first history of computational, model-estimated
emotional states for exactly the authorized `(projectId, profileId)` pair.

- **Authorization:** authenticated session; `VIEWER` minimum via
  `requireProjectAccess`. Organization identity is derived from the authorized
  project. No separate profile lookup is performed; a profile with no
  accessible states returns an empty list.
- **Query:** optional integer `limit`, default `10`, maximum `50`. Values below
  `1`, above `50`, or not representing an integer return `invalid_input`
  (400). Results are ordered by `timestamp DESC, createdAt DESC, id DESC`.
- **Success (200):** `requestId`, canonical `disclosure` and `disclosureText`,
  and `states`. Each state contains `stateId`, `timestamp`, `emotionVector`,
  `dimensions` (`valence`, `arousal`, `intensity`), `modelIdentity`
  (`modelVersionId`, `name`, `version`, `providerIdentifier`,
  `providerVersion`), `parameterIdentity`, and `initialized`.
- **Empty result:** `200` with `"states": []`.
- **Data exposure:** `confidence`, raw persisted state JSON, diagnostics,
  project/profile identifiers per item, and other internal database fields are
  excluded. Every returned state is domain-validated; invalid persisted data
  fails the entire read with `state_data_invalid` (500).
- **Audit:** each successful read writes exactly one `emotional_state.history_read`
  audit row (`resourceType: emotional_state`, no `resourceId`), with metadata
  limited to `projectId`, `profileId`, `requestId`, and `outcome`. Audit failure
  fails closed with `internal_error` (500); 400, 401, and 403 responses are not
  audited.
- **Errors:** `invalid_input` (400), `unauthenticated` (401), `forbidden` (403),
  `state_data_invalid` (500), `internal_error` (500).

## Response fields that are never exposed

No endpoint returns `confidence`, `confidenceAdjustment`, raw persisted
JSONB or its `metadata`, raw `context`, memories, embeddings, internal
diagnostic payloads, or any field named or functioning as a dominant emotion,
ranking, winner, threshold, composite score, or superiority/comparison measure.

## Scientific disclosure

The transition, latest-state, and bounded state-history endpoints return
`disclosure` (code) and `disclosureText` from the single
frozen constant `SCIENTIFIC_DISCLOSURE_TEXT`, which is byte-identical in the
API and the UI. The wording is:

> EMORA output is a computational, model-estimated emotional state derived from
> the event and context you supplied, using EMORA's deterministic model. It is
> not a measurement of a person's true emotional state. It is not a detection
> of a person's true emotional state. It is not a diagnosis. It is not a
> clinical assessment. It does not establish psychological validity, and it
> must not be used as evidence of what a person actually feels.

## Prohibited interpretation

EMORA's API outputs must not be described or used as measurement, detection,
diagnosis, clinical assessment, or evidence of what a person actually feels,
and must not support psychological-validity claims. Synthetic engineering
results are not evidence of human psychological validity. Synthetic evaluation
and human behavioral evaluation remain separate.

## Out of scope (deliberately not implemented)

- Pagination, cursors, aggregation, comparison, or metric-based multi-profile
  sorting.
- Ranking, dominant emotion, thresholds, composite scores, or any
  superiority/comparison metric.
- ML runtime, hybrid fusion, learned parameters, memory retrieval, RAG,
  embeddings, or vector search.
- API-key issuance or programmatic third-party access (the `api_keys` table is
  schema foundation only).
- Parameter-version HTTP surface, profile update/deletion, project and
  organization administration (create/update/delete), webhooks, rate limiting,
  and evaluation-runtime coupling.

See `docs/security.md` for the authorization model, `docs/privacy.md` for data
handling boundaries, and `docs/evaluation.md` for the evaluation boundary.
